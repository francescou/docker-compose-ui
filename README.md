# Fork of francescou/docker-compose-ui

The original [francescou/docker-compose-ui repository](https://github.com/francescou/docker-compose-ui) is archived. 

Consequently, it is difficult to merge fixes, dependency upgrades, and new features into docker-compose-ui.

Because of this, a fork of docker-compose-ui has been created.

## What is it

Docker Compose UI is a web interface for Docker Compose.

The aim of this project is to provide a minimal HTTP API on top of Docker Compose while maintaining full interoperability with Docker Compose CLI.

The application can be deployed as a single container, there are no dependencies nor databases to install.

## Compose file format compatibility matrix

| Compose file format  | Docker Engine |
| ------------- | ------------- |
| 3.8 | 19.03.0+ |
| 3.7 | 18.06.0+ |
| 3.6 | 18.02.0+ |
| 3.3 - 3.5 | 17.06.0+ |
| 3.0 â€“ 3.2| 1.13.1+ |
| 2.3	| 17.06.0+ |
| 2.2	| 1.13.1+ |
| 2.1	| 1.12.0+ |
| 2.0	| 1.10.0+ |
| 1.0	| 1.9.1+ |

## Getting started

Run the following command in terminal:

    docker run \
    --name docker-compose-ui \
    -p 5000:5000 \
    -w /opt/docker-compose-projects/ \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    rururukenken/docker-compose-ui:1.13.6

You have to wait while Docker pulls the container from the Docker Hub: <https://hub.docker.com/r/rururukenken/docker-compose-ui/>

Then open your browser to `http://localhost:5000`

If you already have docker-compose installed, you can run `docker-compose up` and then open your browser to `http://localhost:8080`.


### Add your own docker-compose projects

to use your own docker-compose projects run this command from the directory containing your docker-compose.yml files:

    docker run \
        --name docker-compose-ui \
        -v $(pwd):$(pwd) \
        -w $(dirname $(pwd)) \
        -p 5000:5000 \
        -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
        rururukenken/docker-compose-ui:1.13.6

you can download my example projects into */home/user/docker-compose-ui/demo-projects/* from https://github.com/nsano-rururu/docker-compose-ui/tree/master/demo-projects

### Load projects from a git repository (experimental)

    docker run \
    --name docker-compose-ui \
    -p 5000:5000 \
    -w /opt/docker-compose-projects-git/ \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock  \
    -e GIT_REPO=https://github.com/nsano-rururu/docker-compose-ui.git \
    rururukenken/docker-compose-ui:1.13.6

### Run from URL prefix

Useful for running multiple applications under the same hostname, ie, Traefik console at `http://hostname.com/traefik/`, DCUI under `http://hostname.com/manage/`, etc.

    docker run \
    --name docker-compose-ui \
    -p 5000:5000 \
    -w /opt/docker-compose-projects/ \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -e DOCKER_COMPOSE_UI_PREFIX=manage/docker \
    rururukenken/docker-compose-ui:1.13.6

### Note about scaling services

Note that some of the services provided by the demo projects are not "scalable" with `docker-compose scale SERVICE=NUM` because of published ports conflicts.

Check out this project if you are interested in scaling up and down a docker-compose service without having any down time: <https://github.com/francescou/docker-continuous-deployment>


### Note about volumes

since you're running docker-compose inside a container you must pay attention to volumes mounted with relative paths, see [Issue #6](https://github.com/francescou/docker-compose-ui/issues/6)

### Integration with external web console

Docker Compose UI support to lauch a console with a shell (one of `/bin/bash` or `/bin/sh`) in a given container if a suitable companion container is available, the only requirement for a web console is to support passing the container id (or name) and the command to exec as querystring parameters.

For e.g. with [bitbull/docker-exec-web-console](https://github.com/bitbull-team/docker-exec-web-console) you can call `http://localhost:8888/?cid={containerName}&cmd={command}`, so you can pass the `WEB_CONSOLE_PATTERN` environment var to docker-compose-ui, that hold the pattern that will be used to build the url to load the console. Such pattern should include the `{containerName}` and `{command}` placeholders.

Example usage:

    docker run \
        --name docker_exec_web_console \
        -p 8888:8888 \
        -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock  \
        -e 'CONTEXT_PATH=/web-console/' \
        bitbull/docker-exec-web-console

    docker run \
        --name docker-compose-ui \
        -p 5000:5000 \
        -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock  \
        -e 'WEB_CONSOLE_PATTERN=http://localhost:8888/web-console/?cid={containerName}&cmd={command}' \
        rururukenken/docker-compose-ui:1.13.6


## Remote docker host

You can also run containers on a remote docker host, e.g.

    docker run \
        --name docker-compose-ui \
        -p 5000:5000 \
        -e DOCKER_HOST=remote-docker-host:2375 \
        rururukenken/docker-compose-ui:1.13.6


### Docker Swarm or HTTPS Remote docker host

The project has been tested against a Docker Engines 1.12 cluster ([swarm mode](https://docs.docker.com/engine/swarm/swarm-tutorial/)).

You need to add two environment properties to use an HTTPS remote docker host: `DOCKER_CERT_PATH` and `DOCKER_TLS_VERIFY`, see [example by @ymote](https://github.com/francescou/docker-compose-ui/issues/5#issuecomment-135697832)

### Authenticated docker registries

If your projects require you to pull images from a private docker registry that requires authentication, you will need to provide a `config.json` file with the necessary configuration options to the docker-compose-ui container at `/root/.docker/config.json`. You can generate the file on any host by performing `docker login [your private registry address]` and copying the resulting file from your ~/.docker directory to where it is needed.

For example:

    docker run \
        --name docker-compose-ui \
        -p 5000:5000 \
        -w /opt/docker-compose-projects/ \
        -v /home/user/.docker/config.json:/root/.docker/config.json:ro \
        rururukenken/docker-compose-ui:1.13.6

## Technologies

Docker Compose UI has been developed using Flask (python microframework) to provide RESTful services and AngularJS to implement the Single Page Application web ui.

The application uses [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose) to monitor and edit the state of a set of docker compose projects (*docker-compose.yml* files).
